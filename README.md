# holbertonschool-back-end

Background Context:
Traditionally, system administrators relied heavily on Bash scripting for automation tasks. However, with the emergence of Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), who possess broader programming skills, there's a shift towards more efficient languages like Python. This project focuses on utilizing Python to access employee data via an API, organizing it, and exporting it into different data structures.

Resources:

    "Friends donâ€™t let friends program in shell script"
    Understanding APIs: What is an API? What is a REST API?
    Overview of microservices architecture
    Guidelines for clean Python coding: PEP8 Python style

Learning Objectives:
Upon completing this project, you should be able to explain:

    Limitations of Bash scripting
    Concept of APIs and REST APIs
    Microservices architecture
    CSV and JSON formats
    Python coding standards for package, module, class, variable, function, and constant names

Requirements:

    Editors: vi, vim, emacs
    Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Python 3.8.x
    Code standards: Follow PEP8 Python style
    Documentation: Include README.md and module documentation
    Error handling: Use get method for dictionary access
    Execution: Use if __name__ == "__main__": to prevent execution on import
